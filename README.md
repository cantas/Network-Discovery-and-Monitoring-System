And this is our senior project NDMS, open-source, Java based Network Discovery and Monitoring System & will be released under the GNU GPL license.

Network Discovery
The host, who is user, will be able to discover devices which are in the same or determined network. After the discovery process, our NDMS will show the topology of network with hierarchic graphical interface.

Network Monitoring
The client will be able to observe network devices which have been found by discovery process of our NDMS such as traffic,temperature of the devices, and opearting systems works on devices

It is just an idea. After we compelete Discovering and Monitoring, We will introduce NDMS v2 with remote configuration option. Network admin can configure devices with user-interface easily
