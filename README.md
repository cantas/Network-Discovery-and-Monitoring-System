And this is our senior project NDMS, open-source, Java based Network Discovery and Monitoring System & will be released under the GNU GPL license.

The host, who is user, will be able to discover devices which are in the same or determined network. After the discovery process, our NDMS will show the topology of network with hierarchic graphical interface.
